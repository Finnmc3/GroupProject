## Reasearching income inequality

By extracting data on over 32000 people from a census taken in 1994 by UCLA we aim to find out which variables, such as gender, race and age, have the largest affect on a persons income. Hence our research into the income inequality between identities should make clear whether or not their is any clear discrepancies between certain types of people and if so which types of people are discriminated against the most. Furthermore we will then extrapolate this data using modeling methods in order to predict a persons class based on their identity.

# Gender vs class
.pull-left[ Here we have a plot that demonstrates a clear discrepancy between the income class of males and females. Note that our "Class" variable is binary as it takes on only the values "above 50 k" and "below 50k". With this is mind we can see that males are almost 3 times more likeyl to be "upper class" than that of females. ]

# Using xaringan

---

# xaringan

- The presentation is created using the `xaringan` package

- Use `---` to separate slides and `--` for incremental builds

--

- Like this

---

# Layouts

You can use plain text

- or bullet points

.pull-left[
or text in two columns $^*$
]
.pull-right[
- like
- this
]

.footnote[
[*] And add footnotes
]

# Code

```{r boring-regression}
# a boring regression
model <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
tidy(model)
glance(model)
```

---

# Plots

```{r recode-species, echo = FALSE}
# In this chunk I'm doing a bunch of analysis that I don't want to present 
# in my slides. But I need the resulting data frame for a plot I want to present.
iris_modified <- iris %>%
  mutate(Species = fct_other(Species, keep = "setosa"))
```

```{r plot-iris, echo = FALSE}
# Code hidden with echo = FALSE
# Uses modified iris dataset from previous chunk
# Play around with height and width until you're happy with the look
ggplot(data = iris_modified, mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +

## Plot and text

.pull-left[
- Some text

.pull-right[
```{r warning=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.width=4, echo=FALSE}
# see how I changed out.width and fig.width from defaults

# Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r iris-table, echo = FALSE}
kable(head(iris), format = "html")
```

---

# Images

```{r castle, echo = FALSE, out.width = "55%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Image credit: Photo by JÃ¶rg Angeli on Unsplash."}
include_graphics("img/edinburgh-castle.jpg")
```

Or you can also include a full page image. See next slide.

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

# Feeling adventurous?

- Want to find out more about `xaringan`? See https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1.

- You are welcome to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

- But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. The 
`xaringanthemer` provides some solutions for this that: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer.

- And if you want more bells and whistles, there is also `xaringanExtra`: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra.
