## About Our Dataset

---
## Adult Data

Our main data set is called "Adult data" and contains details of over 3300 people from a census taken in the US in 1994. Note that all of those participating in the census are over 16 years old. The key variables used in our data set are as follows:

--

- age

--

- education

--

- sex

--

- hours_per_week

--

- class

--

- race

---
class: center, middle

## Data Wrangling

---
##Wrangling our dataset

Our data set did not contain any column names so our first call of action was to name the variables.

---
##Creating binary variables

Since our research invloves using binary variables to create predictive models we had to change some of our variables to make them binary - even when this meant a slight loss of information.

--

- We creates a new variable called "has_degree" which takes on 1 if a person has bachelors, masters or PHD and 0 otherwise


- similarly we mutated the race variable such that it takes on 1 if a person is white and 0 otherwise. Although this means we lose some information it allows us to simplify our predictions and still lets us see discrimination towards minorities.

#Analysis 1 
##looking at how age, work-hours and sex are related to income class
---
##How are age and class related

Observe that the overall distributions are similar however there are much more lower-class people and they generally have a younger age:

- mean age for upper class is 44
- mean age for lower-class is 37


```{r warning=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.width=4, echo=FALSE}
adult_data %>% ggplot() + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = age, colour = class))
```
---
##So why are upper-class people older?
One such possibility is that people generally tend to work more hours as they get older hence they may make more money for working more hours. 

```{r warning=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.width=4, echo=FALSE}
adult_data %>% ggplot() + geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = age, y = hours_per_week))
```
---
##hours worked vs age
```{r warning=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.width=4, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(data = adult_data, aes(x = age, y = hours_per_week)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", 
              se = FALSE) +
  labs(
    title = "Age vs hours worked per week",
    x = "age (years)",
    y = "hours-per-week"
  )

linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm") %>%
  fit(hours_per_week ~ age, data = adult_data) %>%
  tidy()

```

##Analysis 2 - looking at how sex, race and degree relate to income class
---
# Gender vs class
.pull-left[ Here we have a plot that demonstrates a clear discrepancy between the income class of males and females. Note that our "Class" variable is binary as it takes on only the values "above 50 k" and "below 50k". With this is mind we can see that males are almost 3 times more likely to be "upper class" than that of ]
.pull-right[]
```{r warning=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.width=4, echo=FALSE}
# see how I changed out.width and fig.width from defaults
# to make the figure bigger
percentage_sex_data <- adult_data %>%
  group_by(sex, class) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>%
  mutate(percentage = count / sum(count) * 100)


percentage_sex <- ggplot(percentage_sex_data, aes(x = sex, y = percentage, fill = class)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(percentage, 1), "%")), vjust = -0.5, position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

#Logistic regression

#Logistic regression results

After careful consideration we came to conclusion that sex, race and university degrees were the most interesting predictors of a persons income and also from the plots above there seems to be a clear disparity within them. Therefore, in an attempt to keep our model as simple as possible, our logistic regression uses only sex, race and degree as predictors. This resulted in the following table:

```{r logistics-table, echo = FALSE}
adult_data$class <- factor(adult_data$class)

class_fit <- logistic_reg() %>%
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  fit(class ~ race + sex + has_degree, data = adult_data, family = "binomial")

tidy(class_fit)
```
note that we transformed the data in such a way that race takes on the value 1 if the person is white and 0 otherwise. This is because we wanted to see specifically how being in a minority may affect people and it also allows the data to be further simplified leading to better predictions.

#Creating our prediction model

By using the data from the previous slide we arrive at the following model:

 $\log\left(\frac{p}{1 - p}\right) = -2.96 + 0.494 \times \text{race} + 1.3 \times \text{sex} + 1.45 \times \text{degree}$

<br>

--
Which means that:

$p = \frac{1}{1 + e^{2.96 - 0.494 \times \text{race} - 1.3 \times \text{sex} - 1.45 \times \text{degree}}}$

--

We then turned this data into a table to look at the results. Notice that a white male with a degree is over 11 times more likely to be of an upper class income status than that of a non-white female with no degree:
<br>
```{r dataframe, echo = FALSE}
data.frame(
race = c( 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0),
sex = c( 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0),
degree = c( 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0),
p = c("57%", "48%", "27%", "24%", "18%", "16%", "8%", "5%")
)
```

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

# Feeling adventurous?

- Want to find out more about `xaringan`? See https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1.

- You are welcome to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

- But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. The 
`xaringanthemer` provides some solutions for this that: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer.

- And if you want more bells and whistles, there is also `xaringanExtra`: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra.
