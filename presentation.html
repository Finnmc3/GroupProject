## About Our Dataset

---
## Adult Data

Our main data set is called "Adult data" and contains details of over 3300 people from a census taken in the US in 1994. Note that all of those participating in the census are over 16 years old. The key variables used in our data set are as follows:

--

- Age

--

- Education

--

- Sex

--

- Hour worked per week

--

- Race

--

- Income ( &gt;50K or &lt;50K)

---
class: center, middle

## Data Wrangling

---
##Wrangling our dataset

Our data set did not contain any column names so our first call of action was to name the variables.


```r
#Changing the variable names for adult data
colnames(adult_data) &lt;- c("age", "workclass", "id", "education", "education-num", "marital-status",
                          "occupation", "relationship", "race_old", "sex", "capital_gain",
                          "capital_loss", "hours_per_week", "native-country", "class")
```

---
##Creating binary variables

- We creates a new variable called "has_degree" which takes on 1 if a person has bachelors, masters or PHD and 0 otherwise

- similarly we mutated the race variable such that it takes on 1 if a person is white and 0 otherwise. Although this means we lose some information it allows us to simplify our predictions and still lets us see discrimination towards minorities.


```r
#Here we have transformed the race variable to make it binary depending on if the person is white or not (1 for white 0 for other)
is_white &lt;- function(x){ifelse(x == " White", 1, 0)}

has_degree &lt;- function(x){ifelse(x == " Bachelors" | x == " Masters" | x == " Doctorate", 1, 0)}

adult_data &lt;- adult_data %&gt;% mutate(race = is_white(race_old))
adult_data &lt;- adult_data %&gt;% select(-race_old)


#Here we have created a new "has degree" variable which is a binary value taking on 1 if the person has a degree
has_degree &lt;- function(x){ifelse(x == " Bachelors" | x == " Masters" | x == " Doctorate", 1, 0)}

adult_data &lt;- adult_data %&gt;% mutate(has_degree = has_degree(education))
adult_data &lt;- adult_data %&gt;% 
  select(-capital_gain, -capital_loss)
```

#Analysis 1 
##looking at how age, work-hours and sex are related to income class
---
##How are age and class related

Observe that the overall distributions are similar however there are much more lower-class people and they generally have a younger age:

- mean age for upper class is 44
- mean age for lower-class is 37


&lt;img src="presentation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="50%" /&gt;
---
##So why are upper-class people older?
One such possibility is that people generally tend to work more hours as they get older hence they may make more money for working more hours. 


```
## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = "cs")'
```

&lt;img src="presentation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="50%" /&gt;


---
##Additional evidence

So clearly we can see that as age increases so too does the number of hours worked
namely, we have:

`\(\text{hours_per_week} = 38 + 0.0622 \times \text{age}\)`




```
## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'
```

&lt;img src="presentation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="50%" /&gt;

```
## # A tibble: 2 × 5
##   term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value
##   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 (Intercept)  38.0      0.205       186.  0       
## 2 age           0.0622   0.00500      12.4 2.02e-35
```

---
##Looking at residuals

&lt;img src="presentation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="80%" /&gt;
---
##But does working more relate to earning more?
A logistic regression was made for the class variable using hours_per_week as the predictor:

```
## # A tibble: 2 × 5
##   term           estimate std.error statistic p.value
##   &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 (Intercept)     -3.10     0.0529      -58.6       0
## 2 hours_per_week   0.0464   0.00118      39.2       0
```
-  Hence some basic calculations show that for every year older a person is their probability of being predicted as upper class increases by roughly 0.2%
---
##Conclusive thoughts
 
 So in this first analysis we came to the conclusion that older people tend to be financially better off. We attempt to give an explanation to this using data analysis in the following way:
 
--
 
 - Older people tend to work more hours
 
--

 - People who work more hours tend to earn more
 
--
 
 - Therefore older people have greater chance of earning more

##Analysis 2
##looking at how sex, race and degree relate to income class
---
#The relationship between sex and class
.pull-left[ Here we have a plot that demonstrates a clear discrepancy between the income class of males and females. Note that our "Class" variable is binary as it takes on only the values "above 50 k" and "below 50k". With this is mind we can see that males are almost 3 times more likely to be "upper class" than that of ]
.pull-right[]

```
## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'sex'. You can override using the `.groups`
## argument.
```

&lt;img src="presentation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="50%" /&gt;

##The relationship between education and class
It looks as if better degrees tend to have a better blue to red ratio which implies a larger proportion of upper class

#Logistic regression results

After careful consideration we came to conclusion that sex, race and university degrees were the most interesting predictors of a persons income and also from the plots above there seems to be a clear disparity within them. Therefore, in an attempt to keep our model as simple as possible, our logistic regression uses only sex, race and degree as predictors. This resulted in the following table:


```
## # A tibble: 4 × 5
##   term        estimate std.error statistic   p.value
##   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 (Intercept)   -2.96     0.0520     -57.0 0        
## 2 race           0.494    0.0453      10.9 1.09e- 27
## 3 sex Male       1.30     0.0356      36.4 3.37e-290
## 4 has_degree     1.45     0.0297      48.9 0
```
note that we transformed the data in such a way that race takes on the value 1 if the person is white and 0 otherwise. This is because we wanted to see specifically how being in a minority may affect people and it also allows the data to be further simplified leading to better predictions.


---
#Creating our prediction model

By using the data from the previous slide we arrive at the following model:

 `\(\log\left(\frac{p}{1 - p}\right) = -2.96 + 0.494 \times \text{race} + 1.3 \times \text{sex} + 1.45 \times \text{degree}\)`

&lt;br&gt;

--
Which means that:

`\(p = \frac{1}{1 + e^{2.96 - 0.494 \times \text{race} - 1.3 \times \text{sex} - 1.45 \times \text{degree}}}\)`

--

We then turned this data into a table to look at the results. Notice that a white male with a degree is over 11 times more likely to be of an upper class income status than that of a non-white female with no degree:

```
##   race sex degree   p
## 1    1   1      1 57%
## 2    0   1      1 48%
## 3    1   0      1 27%
## 4    1   1      0 24%
## 5    0   0      1 18%
## 6    0   1      0 16%
## 7    1   0      0  8%
## 8    0   0      0  5%
```


---
#Conclusive Results
Our findings clearly indicate that following demographic has the largest proportion of upper-class citizens:

--

- Older age

--

- Male

--

- White

--

- Having a Degree

--

## A Final Word

What we have quantified in here is alarming and disturbing. However, one aspect that makes this discrimination so difficult to address is that the experiment, as well-designed as it is, cannot send us much signal about why this prejudice is occurring. It is only possible to say that discrimination is happening. Finding strong evidence of racism, sexism and ageism for individual cases is a persistent challenge in enforcing anti-discrimination laws.
